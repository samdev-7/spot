# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Spot Search browser extension (hereby referred to as "Extension") for browser applications that was created by Sam Liu (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## Information Collection and Use

The Extension does not obtain and does not collect any information when you download and use it.

If you choose to contact the Service Provider, information you share to the Service Provider, such as your email address or name, may be used only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry and will be deleted after the inquiry has been resolved.

## Third Party Access

The Extension does not obtain and does not collect any information. However, when you use the extension, the Extension may use third party providers, such as Google, to complete your search query. Information such as your IP address may be accessible to third party providers to complete the search query. The Extension does not collect information. If you use our extension to find a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Opt-Out Rights

## Data Retention Policy

## Children

The Service Provider does not use the Extension to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

As the Extension does not obtain and does not collect any information, the Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Extension and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Extension and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Extension and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (privacy@samliu.dev) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

## Security

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. As the Extension does not obtain and does not collect any information, there is no information to safeguard.

## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
